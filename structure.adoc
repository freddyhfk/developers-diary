*About the structure:*

To start of this notebook is devided in four categories. These are:

* cheatsheets
** collections for commands for a special technologies
* learnings
** for collecting work related Ooupsie's
* tech
** for deep diving into new topics
* tooling
** to manifest a workset of useful configurations
** in case this section gets too spacious, I will consider moving it into a separate project

Each of these sections has a separate folder containing each a file with the same name. This should form an entry point to each of the sections to be included to the
link:index.adoc[index file]. Within the folders each topic should get a separate file.
